# Red Planet DAO — Bridging the Physical World and Web3

<img width="3172" height="1831" alt="noBgColor" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8e978df-bcc8-4115-989c-454c895bc790" />

> *[Red Planet DAO](https://linktr.ee/rpdao) is a comprehensive next-generation decentralized platform that combines physical mining, Web3 technologies, DAO mechanics, and NFT tools to create a sustainable and scalable ecosystem. The goal of the project is to create a real and reliable value base for the Cosmos ecosystem, its users, and partner communities. The project is not focused on NFTs — NFTs are used solely as proof of ownership of a portion of computing power. An important architectural detail is that Red Planet DAO functions as a [POSTHUMAN](http://twitter.com/POSTHUMAN_DVS) subDAO.*

## Project Architecture: Three Levels of Red Planet DAO

### ***I. Layer One: Physical Infrastructure***

![photo_2025-04-21_12-13-22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c6dd396-3621-47f4-aa64-954989ad4b99)

At the core of Red Planet DAO lies real mining infrastructure, equipped with physical ASIC miners operating on various algorithms:

• Bitcoin $BTC — Sha-256;  
• Dogecoin $DOGE — Scrypt;  
• Litecoin $LTC — Scrypt.  

This infrastructure forms the foundation of the ecosystem, where every NFT and DAO product is backed by actual computational power. This eliminates speculative value and ties the products directly to a physical asset.

### ***II. Layer Two: DAO Product on the Osmosis Network***

![DAO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eee50c84-851e-4b61-b7bf-93de7283dc3d)

The [key product](https://daodao.zone/dao/osmo1snl84npn3pzr4tvphuh7nyqdqr960s9kx29ecex6975su3k0386qze59am/home) is a decentralized DAO solution built on the [DAODAO](https://x.com/DA0_DA0) platform ([Osmosis](https://x.com/osmosiszone)).

*Core functionalities:*

• Access to computational power via DAO mechanisms.  
• Rewards for computations are received in $WBTC (Osmosis Network).  
• Direct Proof-of-Work mining for Bitcoin.  
• Easy joining/leaving the DAO — no speculative NFTs involved.  
• This layer provides the essential infrastructure for Red Planet DAO — serving as a base to support both internal and partner products within the Cosmos ecosystem, establishing a strong connection between Web3 architecture and physical computation.

### ***III. Layer Three: Web3 — NFT Instruments***

#### *1. NFT collection: [“Purt the Adventurer”](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1peea6sz2qh34w5c9x8dmde89ykkaxwgt7e9kg7dnh2hvd2mtptcqswa9xq/tokens) on [Stargaze](https://x.com/StargazeZone)*

![collection_logo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33152ea4-e552-4108-90a4-3a826f4e5d6d)

Created by community request to enable altcoin mining. Represents a hybrid model:

• NFT = fractional ownership of [Bitmain “L9”](https://x.com/BITMAINtech) miner ($DOGE + $LTC).  
• Freely tradable on Stargaze.  
• A highly volatile instrument, dependent on:  
 • price of $DOGE;  
 • price of LTC;  
 • NFT market value;  
 • mining difficulty.  
• Includes an autoconversion mechanism that transforms mined assets into $BTC, adding cross-chain utility.  

Although this tool operates outside Cosmos in terms of mining mechanics, it still fits within Red Planet DAO’s broader value logic by serving as a cross-ecosystem bridge.

#### *2. NFT collection: [“Red Planet NFT”](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1vk8fmh259xr4yz9qqh4x3xfrck80nvl9fu6d9gcaqjksx94xc6nqxzea0t/tokens) (Stargaze, **[open mint](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1vk8fmh259xr4yz9qqh4x3xfrck80nvl9fu6d9gcaqjksx94xc6nqxzea0t)**)*

![Title_collection](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d74a17f3-906e-4859-8879-3ecd778bcad0)

A scalable mining tool based on a combined computational model:

• Bitcoin miners form the base, with some altcoin miners added. Holders receive composite computational power.  
• After reaching 70–80% of the collection minted, the system unlocks autonomous scalability:  
 - *each NFT autonomously increases its internal computational capacity via the global miner pool.*
 
**Primary goal:** facilitate DAO growth through increasing hash rate and decentralized infrastructure scaling.

#### *3. NFT collection: [“MiAmigos”](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/miamigos-memes-mining-and-intergalactic-brotherhood-f09736e19127) on [Stargaze](https://www.stargaze.zone/m/stars1lxl4hrx2cfl0qujl0xyz0jtlzftn3y84rzyn3jgshfznjmvfplzs6pplac/tokens)*

![MiAmigos](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfdbc8b7-fbb8-4844-b26b-9f8740bd738a)

Created for community engagement, including:

• Giveaways, activities, meme mechanics.  
• Integration with multiple projects.  
• Backed by the Red Planet NFT base product.

A portion of the collection was [distributed freely](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/nftnomics-miamigos-f0bf1c387d66) among various communities to foster connections and network-wide interaction.

## Project support and integration

![photo_2025-03-31_23-09-20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d147d91f-7466-4b39-813b-9a1dfa379f03)

[Red Planet DAO](https://linktr.ee/rpdao) actively collaborates with Web3 projects, offering physical and decentralized support.

**Goal:** co-create a platform for mutual growth and shared utility. DAO serves as an inter-project connector, offering:

• Bitcoin-based backing  
• Distribution channel for hash power  
• Long-term utility foundation

**Examples of integrations:** Projects like [CosmoNibble](http://twitter.com/CosmosNibble), [Galactic Odyssey](http://twitter.com/GalOdysseyNFT), [Binjas](http://twitter.com/binjas2025), [Weird Friends](http://twitter.com/weirdfriennds) and [MiAmigos](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/amigo-guild-web3-community-synchronisation-protocol-ea231e49902a) are already integrated into the platform.

### ***Case Study:***

![photo_2025-06-18_05-29-48](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a732c4a9-fa67-4960-b568-a624d2e0bd88)

**[Weird Friends](https://medium.com/weird-friends/%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F-weird-friends-f83583240be8)** uses Red Planet DAO’s mining infrastructure to back its token with Bitcoin. This gives the $WEIRD token real value through computational backing and adds utility via $WBTC rewards for staking in WEIRD DAS.

**“MiAmigos”** is backed by Red Planet NFT, generating $BTC used to buy $WEIRD tokens, which are then distributed to “MiAmigos” NFT holders.

**Result:**

A circular reward loop between Weird Friends and MiAmigos, with additional community activities, all based on Red Planet DAO’s core products. All operations occur across the [Osmosis}(http://twitter.com/osmosiszone) and [Neutron](http://twitter.com/neutron_org) networks, enhancing their value and the broader Cosmos ecosystem.

## Cross-Community Synchronisation

![photo_2025-06-15_22-09-17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62d27156-372f-44ac-b461-e00ca2235fa6)

Cross-Community Synchronisation is a core philosophy of the project. [Red Planet DAO](https://linktr.ee/rpdao) is built on two pillars of value:

**I. People.** We strengthen the community through:

• Events  
• Giveaways  
• Initiatives  
• Contributions  
• Mutual support  
• We deeply value solidarity and collaboration.

**II. Technical Utility**

• We create products with real, measurable value, backed by mining power.  
• We ensure sustainability in all market conditions.  
• We form long-term partnerships based on reliability and utility.

## Red Planet DAO Mission

![GoPt5poXYAAq96C](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d949dd0-995b-44e4-a984-87ac2bab1923)

> *To bring real-world liquidity into Web3 using physical assets and decentralized technology. Using tools like [Osmosis](https://x.com/osmosiszone), [Neutron](http://twitter.com/neutron_org), [DAODAO}(https://x.com/DA0_DA0) and [Stargaze}(https://x.com/StargazeZone), We’re building a hybrid financial ecosystem where Web3 meets real mining infrastructure.*

Our mission within Cosmos is:

• unify people and communities;  
•  build shared utility;  
• contribute to ecosystem expansion.

[Red Planet DAO](https://linktr.ee/rpdao) is not a memecoin, not a liquidity gimmick, and not a vaporware token. It’s a real business, with valuation rooted in physical hardware and real returns.

• This is not tokenized hype — it’s the tangible value of machines and infrastructure.  
• Minimal speculation — maximum transparency and honest economics.  
• The project founder comes from traditional financial markets and aims to bring real clarity and credibility into the crypto space.
